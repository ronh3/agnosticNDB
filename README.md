# agnosticDB

Standalone name database for Mudlet + Achaea. This is a clean-room rewrite intended to be packaged with Muddler.

## Goals
- Track people data (name, class, city, house/order, ranks, notes, iff)
- Highlight names based on politics/enemy status
- Use the Achaea API by default for lookups
- Provide a small in-game UI for politics and notes

## Build
- Work only in `src/`
- Build with `muddle` from repo root

## License
MIT. See `LICENSE`.
